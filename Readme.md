## Dependencies

Dependency management is done using **Maven**, so to run the application locally, the `pom.xml` file must include the following dependencies:

1. **spring-boot-starter-data-jpa**  
   Used to integrate Spring Data JPA, facilitating interaction with databases using the JPA (Java Persistence API) specification.

2. **spring-boot-starter-web**  
   Includes everything needed to create web applications, such as support for RESTful APIs, including Spring MVC and Tomcat as the embedded server.

3. **spring-boot-devtools**  
   Provides features for development, such as automatic reloading and support for real-time configuration changes. It is optional and used only at runtime.

4. **h2**  
   An in-memory database used for development and testing. It allows testing the application without the need for an external database.

5. **mysql-connector-j**  
   JDBC driver to connect to MySQL. Used to interact with a MySQL database at runtime.

6. **spring-boot-starter-test**  
   A set of dependencies for testing, including JUnit, AssertJ, Hamcrest, and Mockito. Used to write and run unit and integration tests.

7. **springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui**  
   Tool for generating API documentation using OpenAPI (Swagger). Allows viewing API documentation in a web interface.

8. **spring-boot-starter-validation**  
   Support for data validation in the application, integrating with Hibernate Validator, allowing you to validate entities and request parameters.

9. **modelmapper**  
   Library for object mapping, facilitating the conversion between different types of objects, especially useful for transferring data between layers.

To check the versions of each dependency used in the project, see the `pom.xml` file.

## Package main/java/resources

Package used to store resource files necessary for the application. Here, we have the following subfolders and files:

### db.migration

Package containing the following files, used by Docker:
- **V1_create_database.sql**: Script for creating the database if it does not exist.
- **V2_create_tables.sql**: Script for creating the tables in the database.
- **V3_inserts.sql**: Script for inserting data into the database.

### sql

Package with the SQL scripts necessary for creating the project's database and populating the parking spots table.

### docker-compose.yml

This file is a Docker Compose file that defines the configuration for a MySQL database service. Below is how to use it:

## Testing Docker for the Parking Service

### Prerequisites
- **Docker**: Ensure that Docker is installed on your machine. You can download and install Docker [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- **Docker Compose**: Docker Compose is usually included with the Docker installation. You can check if it is installed by running `docker-compose --version` in the terminal.

### Step by Step to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the project repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
   cd <PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME>

2. **Create the docker-compose.yml File**: Create a file named docker-compose.yml in the root of your project and add the following content:

version: '3.8'

services:
  mysql:
    image: mysql:8.0
    container_name: mysql-container
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
      MYSQL_DATABASE: parking_db
      MYSQL_USER: user
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: user
    ports:
      - "3307:3306"
    volumes:
      - mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql
    networks:
      - my-network

volumes:
  mysql-data:

networks:
  my-network:


3. **Start the Container**: In the terminal, within the project folder, run the following command to start the container:

docker-compose up -d

The -d parameter runs the container in the background.

4. **Check Running Containers**: To check if the MySQL container is running, use the command:

docker ps

You should see mysql-container in the list of running containers.

5. **Connect to MySQL**: To connect to the MySQL database, you can use a MySQL client (like MySQL Workbench) or the terminal. Use the following credentials:

-Host: localhost
-Port: 3307
-User: user
-Password: user
-Database: parking_db

If you are using the terminal, you can connect using the following command:

docker exec -it mysql-container mysql -u user -p

Then, enter the password (user) when prompted.

6. **Run the Database Script**: After connecting to MySQL, execute the SQL commands provided in your database creation script. You can copy and paste the script into the MySQL client or terminal.

**Example Database Creation Script**:

CREATE DATABASE parking_db;
USE parking_db;

CREATE TABLE vehicle(
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    plate VARCHAR(8),
    category VARCHAR(30),
    type_vehicle VARCHAR(30),
    active BOOLEAN,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

CREATE TABLE ticket(
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    vehicle INT,
    entry_date DATETIME,
    gate_entry INT,
    exit_date DATETIME,
    gate_exit INT,
    price DOUBLE,
    parked BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    PRIMARY KEY (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (vehicle) REFERENCES vehicle(id)
);

CREATE TABLE parking_spot(
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    reserved BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    vacancy_occupied BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    occupied_by INT,
    active_vacancy BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    ticket_id INT,
    parked BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    PRIMARY KEY (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (occupied_by) REFERENCES vehicle(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (ticket_id) REFERENCES ticket(id)
);

SET @rownum = 0;
INSERT INTO parking_spot (id, reserved, vacancy_occupied, active_vacancy)
SELECT @rownum := @rownum + 1 AS number,
CASE
    WHEN @rownum <= 200 THEN 1
    ELSE 0
END AS reserved,
FALSE AS vacancy_occupied,
TRUE AS active_vacancy
FROM (
    SELECT 1 UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 3 UNION SELECT 4 UNION SELECT 5
    UNION SELECT 6 UNION SELECT 7 UNION SELECT 8 UNION SELECT 9 UNION SELECT 10
) AS t1,
(
    SELECT 1 UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 3 UNION SELECT 4 UNION SELECT 5
    UNION SELECT 6 UNION SELECT 7 UNION SELECT 8 UNION SELECT 9 UNION SELECT 10
) AS t2,
(
    SELECT 1 UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 3 UNION SELECT 4 UNION SELECT 5
    UNION SELECT 6 UNION SELECT 7 UNION SELECT 8 UNION SELECT 9 UNION SELECT 10
) AS t3,
(
    SELECT 1 UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 3 UNION SELECT 4 UNION SELECT 5
    UNION SELECT 6 UNION SELECT 7 UNION SELECT 8 UNION SELECT 9 UNION SELECT 10
) AS t4
WHERE @rownum < 500;

**Stopping the Container**
When you finish using the service, you can stop the container with the command:

docker-compose down

With these steps, you should be able to test the parking service locally using Docker. Ensure that all services are working correctly and that you can access the database as needed.

## Package `main/java/model`
Package containing the entity classes of the system. This package is subdivided into:

### dto
Package containing all Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) used to transfer data between application layers. The following classes are included:

1. **ParkingSpotCreateDto**: Represents the information needed to create a parking spot.
2. **ParkingSpotResponseDto**: Represents the response for a request related to a parking spot.
3. **ParkingSpotSummaryDto**: Provides a summary of parking spot information, including the number of individual occupied spots, total capacity of individual spots, number of occupied monthly spots, and total capacity of monthly spots.
4. **ParkingSpotUpdateDto**: DTO designed to update information about parking spots.
5. **TicketCreateDto**: Represents the information needed to create a ticket, excluding those that will be provided only upon vehicle exit.
6. **TicketResponseDto**: DTO for a vehicle's exit from the parking lot, updating ticket information.
7. **VehicleRequestDTO**: Used to encapsulate vehicle information during a request.
8. **VehicleResponseDTO**: Contains the information needed for a response regarding a vehicle request.

## DTOs Usage

As will be seen next, the DTOs are used in the controller layer.

### dto/mapper
This package is responsible for defining the classes and interfaces that convert domain model entities into DTOs. Here, the DTOs defined in the DTO package are converted into each other. The following classes are found in the mapper package:

1. **ParkingSpotMapper**: Maps the necessary conversions to transform the `ParkingSpot` entity into its DTOs, according to the scenario.
2. **TicketMapper**: Similar to the parking spot mapper, this performs the necessary conversions for the `Ticket` class.
3. **VehicleMapper**: Contains the necessary conversions for the `Vehicle` class.

### entity
Another sub-package of the model, the `entity` package defines the classes that represent the domain entities of the system. These classes are mapped to tables in the database and reflect the data structure used by the application. Here, we find the following classes and enums:

1. **Category**: An enum that defines the different types of vehicle categories in the system as follows:
   - **MONTHLY_PAYER**: Vehicles that pay a monthly fee.
   - **CASUAL**: Vehicles that use the parking lot occasionally and do not require registration.
   - **DELIVERY_TRUCK**: Delivery trucks that require prior registration.
   - **PUBLIC_SERVICE**: Public service vehicles that may have free access to the parking lot.

2. **ParkingSpot**: A class that represents a parking spot. Jakarta Persistence annotations are used here to define the behavior regarding the database. These annotations facilitate data persistence and the mapping between the application and the database.

3. **Ticket**: A class that represents the ticket. Similar to the case of parking spots, Jakarta annotations are used to indicate the properties of the table in the database.

4. **TypeVehicle**: An enum with the types of vehicles accepted in the system:
   - **PASSENGER_CAR**: Passenger cars, which can be monthly or occasional, occupy 2 spots.
   - **MOTORCYCLE**: Motorcycles, which can also be monthly or occasional, occupy 1 spot.
   - **DELIVERY_TRUCK**: Delivery trucks that require registration and occupy 4 spots.
   - **PUBLIC_SERVICE**: Public service vehicles that do not require registration and do not occupy spots.

5. **Vehicle**: A class that represents the vehicle entity.

### enums
Package containing the `FilterTypeEnum` class, used by the `Ticket`.

# main/java/repository

Package that defines the interfaces implemented to access and manipulate data persisted in the database:

## 1. ParkingSpotRepository

The `ParkingSpotRepository` interface extends `JpaRepository`, providing access to CRUD operations for the `ParkingSpot` entity. It includes custom methods for data manipulation:

- **findByVacancy_OccupiedFalse()**: Returns a list of spots that are not occupied.
- **countByVacancyOccupiedAndReserved(boolean occupied, boolean reserved)**: Counts the number of spots with a specific occupancy and reservation state (false or true), considering only active spots.

## 3. VehicleRepository

It includes:

- **findByPlate(String plate)**: Returns an `Optional<Vehicle>` with the vehicle corresponding to the provided plate, allowing for vehicle searches using their identification.
- **findById(Long id)**: Returns an `Optional<Vehicle>` based on the vehicle ID, facilitating the retrieval of a specific vehicle.

# main/java/services

Package with the service classes of the application, responsible for the business logic of the application. The service classes follow this general flow:

1. **Controller**: Calls methods from the `ParkingSpotService` as needed, for example, when receiving HTTP requests.
2. **Service**: Executes business logic, interacts with the repository to access or modify data, and transforms entities into DTOs.
3. **Repository**: Performs direct operations on the database using JPA.

In this package, we have the classes described below.

## ParkingSpotService 

Responsible for encapsulating the business logic related to parking spots, interacting with the repository and transforming entities into DTOs.

### Annotations

- **@Service**: Indicates that the class is a service component, allowing Spring to manage it as a bean. This makes it available for injection in other parts of the application, such as controllers.
- **@Transactional**: Specifies that the annotated methods should be executed within a transaction. This ensures that all operations within the method are treated as a single unit of work, allowing rollback in case of failure.

### Methods and Flow

- **findByVacancyOccupiedFalse()**:
  - Calls the `findByVacancy_OccupiedFalse()` method from `ParkingSpotRepository` to fetch all spots that are not occupied.
  - Uses `ParkingSpotMapper` to convert the list of `ParkingSpot` entities into a list of `ParkingSpotResponseDto`, which is returned to the controller.

- **deleteById(Long id)**:
  - Receives an ID and calls the `deleteById(id)` method from the repository to remove the corresponding spot.

- **updateParkingSpot(ParkingSpotUpdateDto updateDto)**:
  - Receives a DTO with information about monthly and general spot capacities.
  - Calculates the difference between the desired total capacity and the current number of spots, creating new instances of `ParkingSpot` if necessary.
  - Updates the state of monthly and general spots using repository methods, such as `updateMonthlySpots()` and `updateGeneralSpots()`, and deactivates active spots as needed.

- **getParkingSummary()**:
  - Collects information about occupied and available spots by calling repository methods, such as `countByVacancyOccupiedAndReserved()`.
  - Creates a `ParkingSpotSummaryDto` with the collected data and returns it.

## TicketService

Manages the business logic related to vehicles. Similar to the parking spot service class, this uses the `@Service` and `@Transactional` annotations.

### Methods and Flow

- **insert(TicketCreateDto dto)**:
  - Creates a new ticket based on the provided data, such as the vehicle plate and type. Searches for available spots, allocates them according to the vehicle type (motorcycle, car, or delivery truck), and saves the ticket to the database.

- **getByFilter(FilterTypeEnum filter, String value)**:
  - Searches for tickets based on different filters (ID, plate, or spot). Returns a list of tickets corresponding to the applied filter, or all tickets if no filter is specified.

- **delete(Long id)**:
  - Removes a ticket based on its ID, calling the corresponding repository.

- **update(Long id)**:
  - Updates a ticket to register the exit of a vehicle, including setting the exit gate and calculating the amount due based on the duration for casual vehicles.

- **getAvailableSpotsForBigVehicles(List<ParkingSpot> parkingSpots, Category category, int size)**:
  - Searches for and returns a list of contiguous available spots for large vehicles, such as cars and trucks. If there are not enough spots, it throws an exception.

- **getAvailableSpotsForMotorcycles(List<ParkingSpot> parkingSpots, Category category)**:
  - Searches for and returns the first available spot for motorcycles.

## VehicleService

Manages the business logic related to vehicles.

### Methods and Flow

- **save(VehicleRequestDTO vehicleRequestDTO)**:
  - Checks if a vehicle with the same plate already exists in the repository. If it does, it throws a `BadRequestException`.
  - Converts the DTO into a `Vehicle` entity using `VehicleMapper`.
  - Validates the plate format with `validatePlate()`.
  - Saves the vehicle in the repository and returns a `VehicleResponseDTO`.

- **getAllVehicles()**:
  - Obtains all vehicles from the repository and converts them into a list of `VehicleResponseDTO` using `VehicleMapper`.

- **getVehicleByPlate(String plate)**:
  - Searches for a vehicle by its plate number. If found, the vehicle is converted into a `VehicleResponseDTO` and returned. Otherwise, it throws a `NotFoundException`.

- **deleteVehicle(Long id)**:
  - Checks if a vehicle with the specified ID exists. If so, it is removed; otherwise, it throws a `NotFoundException`.

- **update(Long id, VehicleRequestDTO vehicleRequestDTO)**:
  - Calls `findVehicleById()` to check if the vehicle exists. If so, it updates the vehicle using the DTO data and saves the changes to the repository. Otherwise, it throws a `NotFoundException` or `BadRequestException`.

- **findVehicleById(Long id)**:
  - A protected method that searches for a vehicle by ID and returns a `VehicleResponseDTO`, throwing a `NotFoundException` if not found.

4. **SPOT_LIST**: A list of mock parking spots, facilitating easier access and iteration during testing.

This package helps streamline the testing process by providing pre-defined, consistent mock data.

### br.com.compass.parking.parking_service/controller

Package dedicated to the tests of the controllers. Here we have the following classes:

1. **ParkingSpotControllerTest**: Unit test for the `ParkingSpotController`, using JUnit and Mockito. Contains tests for operations such as obtaining a summary of spots, deleting, updating, and retrieving occupied or available spots. The `setUp()` method initializes the `ObjectMapper` and simulates the `ParkingSpotService`. Each test checks the expected HTTP response status and confirms correct interactions with the service. Annotations like `@MockBean` allow the simulation of behaviors during tests.

2. **VehicleControllerTest**: Unit test for the `VehicleController`, utilizing the JUnit and Mockito framework. It contains tests for CRUD operations related to vehicles, such as adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting vehicles. The `setUp()` method initializes the necessary dependencies and objects, such as `VehicleRequestDTO` and `VehicleResponseDTO`. Each test simulates interaction with the `VehicleService`, checks the expected HTTP response status, and confirms that the service methods were called correctly. The use of annotations like `@InjectMocks` and `@Mock` facilitates dependency injection and simulated behavior during tests.

### br.com.compass.parking.parking_service/domain

1. **ParkingSpotRepositoryTest**: Unit test for the `ParkingSpotRepository`, using JUnit and Spring Data JPA. Contains tests that verify the count of occupied and reserved spots, updates of spots, and searches for available and occupied spots. The `setUpAll()` method saves test data before all tests, while the `clean()` method clears data after each test. Each test uses assertions to ensure expected behavior of repository operations, such as counting, updating, and searching for spots.

2. **ParkingSpotServiceTest**: Unit test for the `ParkingSpotService`, using JUnit and Mockito. The test suite covers operations like obtaining a summary of spots, updating spots with valid and invalid data, and deleting spots. The `getParkingSpots_ReturnSummary` method verifies the count of occupied and reserved spots, while `updateParkingSpot_WithValidBody` ensures that a new spot is added correctly. Tests for invalid inputs ensure that appropriate exceptions, such as `InvalidArgumentException` and `ConflictException`, are thrown. Spot deletion is also tested, ensuring exceptions are thrown for invalid IDs. The use of annotations like `@InjectMocks` and `@Mock` facilitates dependency injection and simulated behavior during tests.

### br.com.compass.parking.parking_service/services

Package dedicated to testing the service classes. Here we have the following classes:

1. **VehicleServiceTest**: Unit test suite for the `VehicleService`, using JUnit and Mockito. It tests various operations related to vehicle management, including saving, retrieving, updating, and deleting vehicles. The `beforeEach()` method prepares the necessary objects and initializes the vehicle repository. The tests validate expected behaviors, such as saving a vehicle with valid data, handling exceptions for invalid inputs, and ensuring that repository and mapper methods are called correctly. Exceptions like `BadRequestException` and `NotFoundException` are thrown and verified in error cases, ensuring the robustness of the service logic.
